# Premier League Dashboard

My objective is to build a dashboard to show a bespoke league and key stats on premier league data


## Data Sources
Currently set-up to pull csv with key match results 
- Static data: https://www.football-data.co.uk/

Possible move to pull from an API on a free tier
- API: https://www.api-football.com/
